. Ensure that the environmental variables are set as expected:
 .. Take the node to the LOADER prompt.
 .. Check the environment variable settings with the `printenv` command.
 .. If an environment variable is not set as expected, modify it with the `setenvenvironment_variable_name changed_value` command.
 .. Save your changes using the `saveenv` command.
. The next depends on your system configuration:
 ** If your system has onboard keymanager, NSE or NVE configured, go to xref:bootmedia-encryption-restore.adoc[Post boot media replacement steps for OKM, NSE, and NVE]

 .. Log into the partner node.
 .. Confirm the target node is ready for giveback with the storage failover show command.

. Connect the console cable to the partner node.
. Give back the node using the `storage failover giveback -fromnode local` command.
. At the cluster prompt, check the logical interfaces with the `net int -is-home false` command.
+
If any interfaces are listed as "false", revert those interfaces back to their home port using the net int revert command.

. Move the console cable to the repaired node and run the version -v command to check the ONTAP versions.
. Restore automatic giveback if you disabled it by using the storage failover modify -node local -auto-giveback true command.
