 ** If <lno-DARE> is not displayed in the command output, and the system is running ONTAP 9.6 or later, go to the next section.

. If the impaired controller is part of an HA configuration, disable automatic giveback from the healthy controller: `storage failover modify -node local -auto-giveback false` or `storage failover modify -node local -auto-giveback-after-panic false`

== Check NVE or NSE on systems running ONTAP 9.6 and later
