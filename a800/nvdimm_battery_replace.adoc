To replace the NVDIMM battery, you must remove the controller module, remove the battery, replace the battery, and then reinstall the controller module.

All other components in the system must be functioning properly; if not, you must contact technical support.

== Step 1: Shut down the impaired controller

include::../_include/shutdown_most_frus.adoc[]

== Step 2: Remove the controller module

You must remove the controller module from the chassis when you replace the controller module or replace a component inside the controller module.

. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.
. Unplug the controller module power supplies from the source.
. Release the power cable retainers, and then unplug the cables from the power supplies.
. Loosen the hook and loop strap binding the cables to the cable management device, and then unplug the system cables and SFP and QSFP modules (if needed) from the controller module, keeping track of where the cables were connected. Loosen the hook and loop strap binding the cables to the cable management device, and then unplug the system cables from the controller module, keeping track of where the cables were connected.
+
Leave the cables in the cable management device so that when you reinstall the cable management device, the cables are organized.

. Remove the cable management device from the controller module and set it aside.
. Press down on both of the locking latches, and then rotate both latches downward at the same time.
+
The controller module moves slightly out of the chassis.

. Slide the controller module out of the chassis.
+
Make sure that you support the bottom of the controller module as you slide it out of the chassis.

. Set the controller module aside in a safe place.

== Step 3: Replace the NVDIMM battery

To replace the NVDIMM battery, you must remove the failed battery from the controller module and install the replacement battery into the controller module.

. Open the air duct cover and locate the NVDIMM battery in the riser.

*Attention:* The NVDIMM battery control board LED blinks while destaging contents to the flash memory when you halt the system. After the destage is complete, the LED turns off.

. Locate the battery plug and squeeze the clip on the face of the battery plug to release the plug from the socket, and then unplug the battery cable from the socket.
. Grasp the battery and lift the battery out of the air duct and controller module, and then set it aside.
. Remove the replacement battery from its package.
. Install the replacement battery pack in the NVDIMM air duct:
 .. Insert the battery pack into the slot and press firmly down on the battery pack to make sure that it is locked into place.
 .. Plug the battery plug into the riser socket and make sure that the plug locks into place.
. Close the NVDIMM air duct.
+
Make sure that the plug locks into the socket.

== Step 4: Reinstall the controller module and booting the system

After you replace a FRU in the controller module, you must reinstall the controller module and reboot it.

. Align the end of the controller module with the opening in the chassis, and then gently push the controller module halfway into the system.
+
NOTE: Do not completely insert the controller module in the chassis until instructed to do so.

. Recable the system, as needed.
+
If you removed the media converters (QSFPs or SFPs), remember to reinstall them if you are using fiber optic cables.

. Plug the power cord into the power supply, reinstall the power cable locking collar, and then connect the power supply to the power source.
. Complete the reinstallation of the controller module:
 .. Firmly push the controller module into the chassis until it meets the midplane and is fully seated.
+
The locking latches rise when the controller module is fully seated.
+
NOTE: Do not use excessive force when sliding the controller module into the chassis to avoid damaging the connectors.
+
The controller module begins to boot as soon as it is fully seated in the chassis. Be prepared to interrupt the boot process.

 .. Rotate the locking latches upward, tilting them so that they clear the locking pins, and then lower them into the locked position.
 .. If you have not already done so, reinstall the cable management device.
 .. Interrupt the normal boot process by pressing `Ctrl-C`.

== Step 5: Run diagnostics

After you have replaced a component in your system, you should run diagnostic tests on that component.

Your system must be at the LOADER prompt to start diagnostics.

All commands in the diagnostic procedures are issued from the controller where the component is being replaced.

. If the controller to be serviced is not at the LOADER prompt, reboot the controller: `system node halt -node node_name`
+
After you issue the command, you should wait until the system stops at the LOADER prompt.

. At the LOADER prompt, access the special drivers specifically designed for system-level diagnostics to function properly: `boot_diags`
. Select *Scan System* from the displayed menu to enable running the diagnostics tests.
. Select *Test Memory* from the displayed menu.
. Proceed based on the result of the preceding step:
 ** If the test failed, correct the failure, and then rerun the test.
 ** If the test reported no failures, select Reboot from the menu to reboot the system.

== Step 6: Return the failed part to NetApp
