= Post boot media replacement steps for OKM, NSE, and NVE - AFF A900

Once environment variables are checked, you must complete steps specific to restore  Onboard Key Manager (OKM), NetApp Storage Encryption (NSE) and NetApp Volume Encryption (NVE).

. Determine which section you should use to restore your OKM, NSE, or NVE configurations: If NSE or NVE are enabled along with Onboard Key Manager you must restore settings you captured at the beginning of this procedure.
 ** If NSE or NVE are enabled and Onboard Key Manager is enabled, go to <<Restore NVE or NSE when Onboard Key Manager is enabled>>.
  ** If NSE or NVE are enabled for ONTAP 9.6, go to <<Restore NSE/NVE on systems running ONTAP 9.6 and later>>.

== Restore NVE or NSE when Onboard Key Manager is enabled

. Connect the console cable to the target controller.
. Use the boot_ontap command at the LOADER prompt to boot the controller.
. Check the console output:

|===
| If the console displays...| Then...
a|
The LOADER prompt
a|
Boot the controller to the boot menu: `boot_ontap menu`
a|
Waiting for giveback....
a|

 .. Enter `Ctrl-C` at the prompt
 .. At the message: Do you wish to halt this node rather than wait [y/n]? , enter: `y`
 .. At the LOADER prompt, enter the `boot_ontap menu` command.

+
|===

. At the Boot Menu, enter the hidden command, `recover_onboard_keymanager`, and reply `y` at the prompt.
. Enter the passphrase for the onboard key manager you obtained from the customer at the beginning of this procedure.
. When prompted to enter the backup data, paste the backup data you captured at the beginning of this section, when asked. Paste the output of `security key-manager backup show` OR `security key-manager onboard show-backup` command.
+
NOTE: The data is output from either `security key-manager backup show` or security key-manager onboard show-backup` command.

. At the Boot Menu select the option for Normal Boot.
+
The system boots to Waiting for giveback... prompt.

. Move the console cable to the partner controller and log in as admin.
. Confirm the target controller is ready for giveback with the `storage failover show` command.
. Give back only the CFO aggregates with the `storage failover giveback -fromnode local -only-cfo-aggregates true` command.
 ** If the command fails because of a failed disk, physically disengage the failed disk, but leave the disk in the slot until a replacement is received.
 ** If the command fails because of an open CIFS session, check with the customer how to close out CIFS sessions.
+
NOTE: Terminating CIFS can cause loss of data.

 ** If the command fails because the partner "not ready", wait 5 minutes for the NVRAMs to synchronize.
 ** If the command fails because of an NDMP, SnapMirror, or SnapVault process, disable the process. See the appropriate content for more information.
. Once the giveback completes, check the failover and giveback status with the `storage failover show` and `storage failover show-giveback` commands.
+
Only the CFO aggregates (root aggregate and CFO style data aggregates) will be shown.

. If you are running ONTAP 9.6 or later, run the security key-manager onboard sync:
 .. Run the `security key-manager onboard sync` command and then enter the passphrase when prompted.
 .. Enter the `security key-manager key-query` command to see a detailed view of all keys stored in the onboard key manager and verify that the `Restored` column = `yes/true` for all authentication keys.
+
NOTE: If the `Restored` column = anything other than `yes/true`, contact Customer Support.

 .. Wait 10 minutes for the key to synchronize across the cluster.
. Move the console cable to the partner controller.
. Give back the target controller using the `storage failover giveback -fromnode local` command.
. Check the giveback status, three minutes after it reports complete, using the `storage failover show` command.
+
If giveback is not complete after 20 minutes, contact Customer Support.

. At the clustershell prompt, enter the net int show -is-home false command to list the logical interfaces that are not on their home controller and port.
+
If any interfaces are listed as `false`, revert those interfaces back to their home port using the net int revert command.

. Move the console cable to the target controller and run the `version -v` command to check the ONTAP versions.
. Restore automatic giveback if you disabled it by using the `storage failover modify -node local -auto-giveback true` command.

. Connect the console cable to the target controller.
. Use the boot_ontap command at the LOADER prompt to boot the controller.
. Check the console output:

. Move the console cable to the partner controller and give back the target controller storage using the storage failover giveback -fromnode local -only-cfo-aggregates true local command.
 ** If the command fails because of a failed disk, physically disengage the failed disk, but leave the disk in the slot until a replacement is received.
 ** If the command fails because of an open CIFS sessions, check with customer how to close out CIFS sessions.
+
NOTE: Terminating CIFS can cause loss of data.

 ** If the command fails because the partner is "not ready", wait 5 minutes for the NVMEMs to synchronize.
 ** If the command fails because of an NDMP, SnapMirror, or SnapVault process, disable the process. See the appropriate content for more information.

. Wait 3 minutes and check the failover status with the storage failover show command.
. At the clustershell prompt, enter the `net int show -is-home false` command to list the logical interfaces that are not on their home controller and port.
+
If any interfaces are listed as `false`, revert those interfaces back to their home port using the `net int revert` command.

. Move the console cable to the target controller and run the `version -v` command to check the ONTAP versions.
. Restore automatic giveback if you disabled it by using the `storage failover modify -node local -auto-giveback true` command.
. Use the `storage encryption disk show` at the clustershell prompt, to review the output.
. Use the `security key-manager key-query` command to display the encryption and  authentication keys that are stored on the key management servers.
 ** If the `Restored` column = `yes/true`, you are done and can proceed to complete the replacement process.
 ** If the `Key Manager type` = `external` and the `Restored` column = anything other than `yes/true`, use the security key-manager external restore command to restore the key IDs of the authentication keys.
+
NOTE: If the command fails, contact Customer Support.

 ** If the `Key Manager type` = `onboard` and the `Restored` column = anything other than `yes/true`, use the security key-manager onboard sync command to re-sync the Key Manager type.
+
Use the `security key-manager key-query` command to verify that the `Restored` column = `yes/true` for all authentication keys.
. Connect the console cable to the partner controller.
. Give back the controller using the storage failover giveback -fromnode local command.
. Restore automatic giveback if you disabled it by using the `storage failover modify -node local -auto-giveback true` command.
