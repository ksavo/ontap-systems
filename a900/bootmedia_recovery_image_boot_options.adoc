You must boot the ONTAP image from the USB drive, restore the file system, and verify the environmental variables.

. Ensure that the environmental variables are set as expected:
 .. Take the node to the LOADER prompt.
 .. Check the environment variable settings with the printenv command.
 .. If an environment variable is not set as expected, modify it with the setenvenvironment_variable_name changed_value command.
 .. Save your changes using the saveenv command.
. The next depends on your system configuration:
 ** If your system has onboard keymanager, NSE or NVE configured, go to xref:bootmedia_encryption_restore.adoc[Post boot media replacement steps for OKM, NSE, and NVE]
 ** If your system does not have onboard keymanager, NSE or NVE configured, complete the steps in this section.
. From the LOADER prompt, enter the boot_ontap command.

 .. Log into the partner node.
 .. Confirm the target node is ready for giveback with the storage failover show command.

+
|===

. Connect the console cable to the partner node.
. Give back the node using the storage failover giveback -fromnode local command.
. At the cluster prompt, check the logical interfaces with the net int -is-home false command.
+
If any interfaces are listed as "false", revert those interfaces back to their home port using the net int revert command.

. Move the console cable to the repaired node and run the version -v command to check the ONTAP versions.
. Restore automatic giveback if you disabled it by using the storage failover modify -node local -auto-giveback true command.
