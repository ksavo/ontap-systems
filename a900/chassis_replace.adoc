[.lead]
All other components in the system must be functioning properly; if not, you must contact technical support.

* You can use this procedure with all versions of ONTAP supported by your system.
* This procedure is disruptive. For a two-node cluster, you will have a complete service outage and a partial outage in a multi-node cluster.

== Shut down the node

=== Option 1 (most configurations): Controller is not in a two-node MetroCluster

include::../_include/shutdown_chassis.adoc[]

=== Option 2: Controller is a two-node MetroCluster configuration

CATALYST: procedure needed for two-node MCC.

== Step 2: Remove the power supplies

[.lead]
Removing the power supplies when replacing a chassis involves turning off, disconnecting, and then removing the power supply from the old chassis.

. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.
. Turn off the power supply and disconnect the power cables:
 .. Turn off the power switch on the power supply.
 .. Open the power cable retainer, and then unplug the power cable from the power supply.
 .. Unplug the power cable from the power source.
. Press and hold the orange button on the power supply handle, and then pull the power supply out of the chassis.
+
CAUTION:
+
When removing a power supply, always use two hands to support its weight.

== Step 3: Remove the fans

[.lead]
To remove the fan modules when replacing the chassis, you must perform a specific sequence of tasks.

. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.
. Remove the bezel (if necessary) with two hands, by grasping the openings on each side of the bezel, and then pulling it toward you until the bezel releases from the ball studs on the chassis frame.
. Press the orange button on the fan module and pull the fan module straight out of the chassis, making sure that you support it with your free hand.
+
CAUTION:
+
The fan modules are short. Always support the bottom of the fan module with your free hand so that it does not suddenly drop free from the chassis and injure you.

+
Make sure that you support the bottom of the controller module as you slide it out of the chassis.

. Set the controller module aside in a safe place, and repeat these steps if you have another controller module in the chassis.

== Step 5: Remove the I/O modules

[.lead]
To remove I/O modules from the old chassis, including the NVRAM modules, follow the specific sequence of steps. You do not have to remove the FlashCache module from the NVRAM module when moving it to a new chassis.

. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.
. Unplug any cabling associated with the target I/O module.
+
Make sure that you label the cables so that you know where they came from.

. Remove the target I/O module from the chassis:
 .. Depress the lettered and numbered cam button.
+
The cam button moves away from the chassis.

 .. Rotate the cam latch down until it is in a horizontal position.
+
The I/O module disengages from the chassis and moves about 1/2 inch out of the I/O slot.

 .. Remove the I/O module from the chassis by pulling on the pull tabs on the sides of the module face.

+
Make sure that you keep track of which slot the I/O module was in.

. Set the DCPM module aside in a safe place and repeat this step for the remaining DCPM module.

== Step 7: Replace a chassis from within the equipment rack or system cabinet

[.lead]
You must remove the existing chassis from the equipment rack or system cabinet before you can install the replacement chassis.

. Remove the screws from the chassis mount points.
+
NOTE: If the system is in a system cabinet, you might need to remove the rear tie-down bracket.

. With the help of two or three people, slide the old chassis off the rack rails in a system cabinet or _L_ brackets in an equipment rack, and then set it aside.
. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.
. Using two or three people, install the replacement chassis into the equipment rack or system cabinet by guiding the chassis onto the rack rails in a system cabinet or _L_ brackets in an equipment rack.
. Slide the chassis all the way into the equipment rack or system cabinet.
. Secure the front of the chassis to the equipment rack or system cabinet, using the screws you removed from the old chassis.
. Secure the rear of the chassis to the equipment rack or system cabinet.
. If you are using the cable management brackets, remove them from the old chassis, and then install them on the replacement chassis.
. If you have not already done so, install the bezel.

== Step 8: Move the USB LED module to the new chassis

[.lead]
Once the new chassis is installed into the rack or cabinet, you must move the USB LED module from the old chassis to the new chassis.

. Locate the USB LED module on the front of the old chassis, directly under the power supply bays.
. Press the black locking button on the right side of the module to release the module from the chassis, and then slide it out of the old chassis.
. Align the edges of the module with the USB LED bay at the bottom-front of the replacement chassis, and gently push the module all the way into the chassis until it clicks into place.

== Step 9: Install the de-stage controller power module when replacing the chassis

[.lead]
Once the replacement chassis is installed into the rack or system cabinet, you must reinstall the de-stage controller power modules into it.

. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.
. Align the end of the DCPM module with the chassis opening, and then gently slide it into the chassis until it clicks into place.
+
NOTE: The module and slot are keyed. Do not force the module into the opening. If the module does not go in easily, realign the module and slide it into the chassis.

. Repeat this step for the remaining DCPM module.

== Step 10: Install fans into the chassis

[.lead]
To install the fan modules when replacing the chassis, you must perform a specific sequence of tasks.

. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.
. Align the edges of the replacement fan module with the opening in the chassis, and then slide it into the chassis until it snaps into place.
+
When inserted into a live system, the amber Attention LED flashes four times when the fan module is successfully inserted into the chassis.

. Repeat these steps for the remaining fan modules.
. Align the bezel with the ball studs, and then gently push the bezel onto the ball studs.

== Step 11: Install I/O modules

[.lead]
To install I/O modules, including the NVRAM/FlashCache modules from the old chassis, follow the specific sequence of steps.

You must have the chassis installed so that you can install the I/O modules into the corresponding slots in the new chassis.

. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.
. After the replacement chassis is installed in the rack or cabinet, install the I/O modules into their corresponding slots in the replacement chassis by gently sliding the I/O module into the slot until the lettered and numbered I/O cam latch begins to engage, and then push the I/O cam latch all the way up to lock the module in place.
. Recable the I/O module, as needed.
. Repeat the preceding step for the remaining I/O modules that you set aside.
+
NOTE: If the old chassis has blank I/O panels, move them to the replacement chassis at this time.

== Step 12: Install the power supplies

[.lead]
Installing the power supplies when replacing a chassis involves installing the power supplies into the replacement chassis, and connecting to the power source.

. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.
. Using both hands, support and align the edges of the power supply with the opening in the system chassis, and then gently push the power supply into the chassis until it locks into place.
+
The power supplies are keyed and can only be installed one way.
+
IMPORTANT: Do not use excessive force when sliding the power supply into the system. You can damage the connector.

. Reconnect the power cable and secure it to the power supply using the power cable locking mechanism.
+
IMPORTANT: Only connect the power cable to the power supply. Do not connect the power cable to a power source at this time.

. Repeat the preceding steps for any remaining power supplies.

== Step 13: Install the controller

[.lead]
After you install the controller module and any other components into the new chassis, boot it to a state where you can run the interconnect diagnostic test.

. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.
. Align the end of the controller module with the opening in the chassis, and then gently push the controller module halfway into the system.
+
NOTE: Do not completely insert the controller module in the chassis until instructed to do so.

. Recable the console to the controller module, and then reconnect the management port.
. Connect the power supplies to different power sources, and then turn them on.
. With the cam handle in the open position, slide the controller module into the chassis and firmly push the controller module in until it meets the midplane and is fully seated, and then close the cam handle until it clicks into the locked position.
+
IMPORTANT: Do not use excessive force when sliding the controller module into the chassis; you might damage the connectors.
+
The controller module begins to boot as soon as it is fully seated in the chassis.

. Repeat the preceding steps to install the second controller into the new chassis.
. Boot each node to Maintenance mode:
 .. As each node starts the booting, press `Ctrl-C` to interrupt the boot process when you see the message Press Ctrl-C for Boot Menu.
+
NOTE: If you miss the prompt and the controller modules boot to ONTAP, enter `halt`, and then at the LOADER prompt enter `boot_ontap`, press `Ctrl-C` when prompted, and then repeat this step.

 .. From the boot menu, select the option for Maintenance mode.

== Step 14: Verify and set the HA state of the chassis

[.lead]
You must verify the HA state of the chassis, and, if necessary, update the state to match your system configuration.

. In Maintenance mode, from either controller module, display the HA state of the local controller module and chassis: `ha-config show`
+
The HA state should be the same for all components.

. If the displayed system state for the chassis does not match your system configuration:
 .. Set the HA state for the chassis: `ha-config modify chassis HA-state`
+
The value for HA-state can be one of the following:

  *** ha
  *** mcc
  *** mcc-2n
  *** non-ha

 .. Confirm that the setting has changed: `ha-config show`
. If you have not already done so, recable the rest of your system.
. Exit Maintenance mode: `halt`
+
The LOADER prompt appears.

== Step 15: Running system-level diagnostics

[.lead]
After installing a new chassis, you should run interconnect diagnostics.

Your system must be at the LOADER prompt to start System Level Diagnostics.

All commands in the diagnostic procedures are issued from the node where the component is being replaced.

. If the node to be serviced is not at the LOADER prompt, perform the following steps:
 .. Select the Maintenance mode option from the displayed menu.
 .. After the node boots to Maintenance mode, halt the node: `halt`
+
After you issue the command, you should wait until the system stops at the LOADER prompt.
+
IMPORTANT: During the boot process, you can safely respond `y` to prompts:
. Repeat the previous step on the second node if you are in an HA configuration.
+
NOTE: Both controllers must be in Maintenance mode to run the interconnect test.

. At the LOADER prompt, access the special drivers specifically designed for system-level diagnostics to function properly: `boot_diags`
+
During the boot process, you can safely respond `y` to the prompts until the Maintenance mode prompt (*>) appears.

. Enable the interconnect diagnostics tests from the Maintenance mode prompt: `sldiag device modify -dev interconnect -sel enable`
+
The interconnect tests are disabled by default and must be enabled to run separately.

. Run the interconnect diagnostics test from the Maintenance mode prompt: `sldiag device run -dev interconnect`
+
You only need to run the interconnect test from one controller.

. Verify that no hardware problems resulted from the replacement of the chassis: `sldiag device status -dev interconnect -long -state failed`
+
System-level diagnostics returns you to the prompt if there are no test failures, or lists the full status of failures resulting from testing the component.

. Proceed based on the result of the preceding step.
+
|===
| If the system-level diagnostics tests...| Then...
a|
Were completed without any failures
a|

 .. Clear the status logs: `sldiag device clearstatus`
 .. Verify that the log was cleared: `sldiag device status`
+
The following default response is displayed:
+
----
SLDIAG: No log messages are present.
----

 .. Exit Maintenance mode on both controllers: `halt`
+
The system displays the LOADER prompt.
+
IMPORTANT: You must exit Maintenance mode on both controllers before proceeding any further.

 .. Enter the following command on both controllers at the LOADER prompt: `bye`
 .. Return the node to normal operation:
+
|===
|===
| If your system is running ONTAP...| Then...
a|
With two nodes in the cluster
a|
Issue these commands: `node::> cluster ha modify -configured true``node::> storage failover modify -node node0 -enabled true`
a|
With more than two nodes in the cluster
a|
Issue this command:``node::> storage failover modify -node node0 -enabled true``
a|
In a two-node MetroCluster configuration
a|
Proceed to the next step.         The MetroCluster switchback procedure is done in the next task in the replacement process.
a|
In a stand-alone configuration
a|
You have no further steps in this particular task.

 You have completed system-level diagnostics.

a|
Resulted in some test failures
a|
Determine the cause of the problem.

 .. Exit Maintenance mode: `halt`
 .. Perform a clean shutdown, and then disconnect the power supplies.
 .. Verify that you have observed all of the considerations identified for running system-level diagnostics, that cables are securely connected, and that hardware components are properly installed in the storage system.
 .. Reconnect the power supplies, and then power on the storage system.
 .. Rerun the system-level diagnostics test.
