You can use this example to guide you through how to read and apply a completed worksheet to cable stacks of disk shelves with IOM12/IOM12B modules for quad-pathed connectivity.

.About this task

* This procedure references the following worksheet and cabling example to demonstrate how to read a worksheet to cable controller-to-stack connections.
+
The configuration used in this example is a quad-path HA configuration with two quad-port SAS HBAs on each controller and two stacks of disk shelves with IOM12 modules.

* If you have a single-controller configuration, skip substeps b and d for cabling to a second controller.
* If needed, you can refer to link:install-cabling-rules.html[SAS cabling rules] for information about the controller slot numbering convention, shelf-to-shelf connectivity, and controller-to-shelf connectivity (including the use of port pairs).

.Steps

. Cable port pair 1a/2b on each controller to stack 1:
+
This is the multipathed cabling for stack 1.

 .. Cable controller 1 port 1a to stack 1, first shelf IOM A port 1.
 .. Cable controller 2 port 1a to stack 1, first shelf IOM B port 1.
 .. Cable controller 1 port 2b to stack 1, last shelf IOM B port 3.
 .. Cable controller 2 port 2b to stack 1, last shelf IOM A port 3.

. Cable port pair 2a/1d on each controller to stack 1:
+
This is the quad-pathed cabling for stack 1. Once completed, stack 1 has quad-pathed connectivity to each controller.

 .. Cable controller 1 port 2a to stack 1, first shelf IOM A port 2.
 .. Cable controller 2 port 2a to stack 1, first shelf IOM B port 2.
 .. Cable controller 1 port 1d to stack 1, last shelf IOM B port 4.
 .. Cable controller 2 port 1d to stack 1, last shelf IOM A port 4.

. Cable port pair 1c/2d on each controller to stack 2:
+
This is the multipathed cabling for stack 2.

 .. Cable controller 1 port 1c to stack 2, first shelf IOM A port 1.
 .. Cable controller 2 port 1c to stack 2, first shelf IOM B port 1.
 .. Cable controller 1 port 2d to stack 2, last shelf IOM B port 3.
 .. Cable controller 2 port 2d to stack 2, last shelf IOM A port 3.

. Cable port pair 2c/1b on each controller to stack 2:
+
This is the quad-pathed cabling for stack 2. Once completed, stack 2 has quad-pathed connectivity to each controller.

 .. Cable controller 1 port 2c to stack 2, first shelf IOM A port 2.
 .. Cable controller 2 port 2c to stack 2, first shelf IOM B port 2.
 .. Cable controller 1 port 1b to stack 2, last shelf IOM B port 4.
 .. Cable controller 2 port 1b to stack 2, last shelf IOM A port 4.
