summary: Replacing a drive drawer in a shelf requires you to either halt the entire storage system (HA pair), which allows you to keep data aggregates on the shelf, or you have the option to keep the HA pair up and running, which requires you to move all of the data from the data aggregates residing on the disk drives, and offline and delete the data aggregates. However, if the shelf contains a root aggregate, you must halt the HA pair.

[.lead]
Replacing a drive drawer in a shelf requires you to either halt the entire storage system (HA pair), which allows you to keep data aggregates on the shelf, or you have the option to keep the HA pair up and running, which requires you to move all of the data from the data aggregates residing on the disk drives, and offline and delete the data aggregates. However, if the shelf contains a root aggregate, you must halt the HA pair.

.Before you begin

You need these items for this procedure:

* Antistatic protection
+
NOTE: *Possible hardware damage:* To prevent electrostatic discharge damage to the drive shelf, use proper antistatic protection when handling drive shelf components.

* Replacement drive drawer
* Replacement left and right cable chains
* Flashlight

.About this task

* This procedure applies to shelves having DCM drive drawers and/or DCM2 drive drawers. (Shelves will also have two IOM12 modules or two IOM12B modules.)
+
When a DCM or DCM2 drive drawer fails, you receive a DCM or DCM2 drive drawer to replace it.

[NOTE]
====
If when you replace a failed drive drawer, it results in the shelf having a combination of IOM12 modules and any number of DCM2 drive drawers, you must upgrade the IOM12 FW to version 0300 or later because the IOM12 modules require a version of FW that supports DCM2 drive drawers.

The IOM12 FW upgrade can be done before or after replacing a drive drawer. This procedure has you upgrade the FW as part of the preparation for the drawer replacement procedure.
====

* The DCM drive drawers and the DCM2 drive drawers can be distinguished by their appearance:
+
The DCM drive drawers look like the following:
+

== Prepare to replace a drive drawer

[.Lead]
Before you replace a drive drawer, you must make sure to update IOM12 FW if needed, and either halt the HA pair, which allows you to keep data aggregates on the shelf, or you have the option to keep the HA pair up and running, which requires you to move all of the data from the data aggregates residing on the disk drives, and offline and delete the data aggregates. However, if the shelf contains a root aggregate, you must halt the HA pair. Lastly, you must power off the shelf.

.steps
. Determine if when you replace the failed drive drawer, it results in the shelf having a combination of IOM12 modules and any number of DCM2 drive drawers.
. If the shelf will have a combination of IOM12 modules and any number of DCM2 drive drawers, you must upgrade the IOM12 FW to version 0300 or later; otherwise, go to the next step.
+
Current versions of firmware can be found on the NetApp Support Site.

. If the shelf contains the root aggregate from either controller in the HA pair, or if you chose to halt the HA pair (instead of keeping the HA pair up and running), complete the following substeps; otherwise, go to the next step.
+
NOTE: Data aggregates can remain on the shelf when halting the HA pair.

.. Halt both controllers in the HA pair.
.. Verify that your HA pair halted by checking the storage system console.
.. Power off the shelf.
.. Go to the section, <<Remove the cable chains>>.
. If you chose to keep the HA pair up and running, complete the following substeps:
+
NOTE: If you attempt to replace a drawer with aggregates on the disk shelf, you could cause a system disruption with a multidisk panic.

.. Move all of the data from the data aggregates residing on the disk drives.
+
Data includes, but is not limited to, volumes and LUNs.

.. Offine and delete the aggregates to allow the disk drives to become spares:
+
Commands can be entered from the clustershell of either controller.
+
`storage aggregate offline -aggregate _aggregate_name_`
+
`storage aggregate delete -aggregate _aggregate_name_`
.. Verify that the disk drives have no aggregates (are spares):
 ... Enter the following command from the clustershell of either controller: `storage disk show -shelf _shelf_number_`
 ... Check the output to verify that the drisk drives are spares.
+
Disk drives that are spares show `spare` in the `Container Type` column.
+
NOTE: If you have failed disk drives in the shelf, `broken` appears in the `Container Type` column.
.. Power off the shelf.

== Remove the cable chains
