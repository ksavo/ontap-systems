== Step 6: Replace a chassis from within the equipment rack or system cabinet

.Steps

You must remove the existing chassis from the equipment rack or system cabinet before you can install the replacement chassis.

. Remove the screws from the chassis mount points.
+
NOTE: If the system is in a system cabinet, you might need to remove the rear tie-down bracket.

. With the help of two or three people, slide the old chassis off the rack rails in a system cabinet or _L_ brackets in an equipment rack, and then set it aside.
. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.
. Using two or three people, install the replacement chassis into the equipment rack or system cabinet by guiding the chassis onto the rack rails in a system cabinet or _L_ brackets in an equipment rack.
. Slide the chassis all the way into the equipment rack or system cabinet.
. Secure the front of the chassis to the equipment rack or system cabinet, using the screws you removed from the old chassis.
. Secure the rear of the chassis to the equipment rack or system cabinet.
. If you are using the cable management brackets, remove them from the old chassis, and then install them on the replacement chassis.
. If you have not already done so, install the bezel.

== Step 7: Move the USB LED module to the new chassis

.Steps

Once the new chassis is installed into the rack or cabinet, you must move the USB LED module from the old chassis to the new chassis.

. Locate the USB LED module on the front of the old chassis, directly under the power supply bays.
. Press the black locking button on the right side of the module to release the module from the chassis, and then slide it out of the old chassis.
. Align the edges of the module with the USB LED bay at the bottom-front of the replacement chassis, and gently push the module all the way into the chassis until it clicks into place.

== Step 8: Install the de-stage controller power module when replacing the chassis
