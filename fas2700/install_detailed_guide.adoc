This guide gives detailed step-by-step instructions for installing a typical NetApp system. Use this guide if you want more detailed installation instructions.

== Step 1: Prepare for installation

[.lead]
To install your FAS2700 or AFF A220 system, you need to create an account on the NetApp Support Site, register your system, and get license keys. You also need to inventory the appropriate number and type of cables for your system and collect specific network information.

You need to have access to the Hardware Universe for information about site requirements as well as additional information on your configured system. You might also want to have access to the Release Notes for your version of ONTAP for more information about this system.

https://hwu.netapp.com[NetApp Hardware Universe]

http://mysupport.netapp.com/documentation/productlibrary/index.html?productID=62286[Find the Release Notes for your version of ONTAP 9]

You need to provide the following at your site:

* Rack space for the storage system
* Phillips #2 screwdriver
* Additional networking cables to connect your system to your network switch and laptop or console with a Web browser
* A laptop or console with an RJ-45 connection and access to a Web browser

.Steps
. Unpack the contents of all boxes.
. Record the system serial number from the controllers.

. Set up your account:
 .. Log in to your existing account or create an account.
 .. Register your system.
+
https://mysupport.netapp.com/eservice/registerSNoAction.do?moduleName=RegisterMyProduct[NetApp Product Registration]
. Download and install Config Advisor on your laptop.

Powering up the system
|===

. Download and complete the _Cluster configuration worksheet_.
+
https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_download_file/ECMLP2839002[Cluster Configuration Worksheet]

== Step 2: Install the hardware

[.lead]
You need to install your system in a 4-post rack or NetApp system cabinet, as applicable.

.Steps
. Install the rail kits, as needed.
. Install and secure your system using the instructions included with the rail kit.
+
NOTE: You need to be aware of the safety concerns associated with the weight of the system.
+
image::../media/drw_oie_fas2700_weight_caution.png[]

. Attach cable management devices (as shown).
+
image::../media/drw_cable_management_arm_install.png[]

. Place the bezel on the front of the system.

== Step 3: Cable controllers to your network

[.lead]
You can cable the controllers to your network by using the two-node switchless cluster method or by using the cluster interconnect network.

=== Option 1: Cable a two-node switchless cluster, unified network configuration

[.lead]
Management network, UTA2 data network, and management ports on the controllers are connected to switches. The cluster interconnect ports are cabled on both controllers.

You must have contacted your network administrator for information about connecting the system to the switches.

Be sure to check the illustration arrow for the proper cable connector pull-tab orientation.

image::../media/oie_cable_pull_tab_down.png[]

NOTE: As you insert the connector, you should feel it click into place; if you do not feel it click, remove it, turn it around and try again.

.Steps
. You can use the graphic or the step-by step instructions to complete the cabling between the controllers and to the switches:

. To cable your storage, see link:install_detailed_guide.md#[Cabling controllers to drive shelves]

== Step 4: Cable controllers to drive shelves

[.lead]
You must cable the controllers to your shelves using the onboard storage ports. NetApp recommends MP-HA cabling for systems with external storage. If you have a SAS tape drive, you can use single-path cabling. If you have no external shelves, MP-HA cabling to internal drives is optional (not shown) if the SAS cables are ordered with the system.

=== Option 1: Cable storage on an HA pair with external drive shelves

[.lead]
You must cable the shelf-to-shelf connections, and then cable both controllers to the drive shelves.

Be sure to check the illustration arrow for the proper cable connector pull-tab orientation.

image::../media/oie_cable_pull_tab_down.png[]

.Steps
. Cable the HA pair with external drive shelves:
+
NOTE: The example uses DS224C. Cabling is similar with other supported drive shelves.

. To complete setting up your system, see link:install_detailed_guide.md#[Completing system setup and configuration]

== Step 5: Complete system setup and configuration

[.lead]
You can complete the system setup and configuration using cluster discovery with only a connection to the switch and laptop, or by connecting directly to a controller in the system and then connecting to the management switch.

=== Option 1: Complete system setup if network discovery is enabled

[.lead]
If you have network discovery enabled on your laptop, you can complete system setup and configuration using automatic cluster discovery.

.Steps
. Use the following animation to set one or more drive shelf IDs
+
video::c600f366-4d30-481a-89d9-ab1b0066589b[panopto, title="Animation - Set drive shelf IDs"]

. Plug the power cords into the controller power supplies, and then connect them to power sources on different circuits.
. Turn on the power switches to both nodes.
+
image::../media/drw_turn_on_power_switches_to_psus.png[]
+
NOTE: Initial booting may take up to eight minutes.

. Make sure that your laptop has network discovery enabled.
+
See your laptop's online help for more information.

. Use the following animation to connect your laptop to the Management switch.

=== Option 2: Completing system setup and configuration if network discovery is not enabled

[.lead]
If network discovery is not enabled on your laptop, you must complete the configuration and setup using this task.

.Steps
. Cable and configure your laptop or console:
 .. Set the console port on the laptop or console to 115,200 baud with N-8-1.
+
NOTE: See your laptop or console's online help for how to configure the console port.

 .. Connect the console cable to the laptop or console, and connect the console port on the controller using the console cable that came with your system.
+
image::../media/drw_console_connect_fas2700_affa200.png[]

 .. Connect the laptop or console to the switch on the management subnet.
+
