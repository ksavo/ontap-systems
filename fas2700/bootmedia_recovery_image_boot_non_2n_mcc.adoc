. Ensure that the environmental variables are set as expected:
 .. Take the controller to the LOADER prompt.
 .. Check the environment variable settings with the `printenv` command.
 .. If an environment variable is not set as expected, modify it with the `setenv __environment-variable-name__ __changed-value__` command.
 .. Save your changes using the `savenv` command.
. The next depends on your system configuration:
 ** If your system has onboard keymanager, NSE or NVE configured, go to xref:bootmedia-encryption-restore.adoc[Restore OKM, NSE, and NVE as needed]

 .. Log into the partner controller.
 .. Confirm the target controller is ready for giveback with the `storage failover show` command.


|===

. Connect the console cable to the partner controller.
. Give back the controller using the `storage failover giveback -fromnode local` command.
. At the cluster prompt, check the logical interfaces with the `net int -is-home false` command.
+
If any interfaces are listed as "false", revert those interfaces back to their home port using the `net int revert` command.

. Move the console cable to the repaired controller and run the `version -v` command to check the ONTAP versions.
. Restore automatic giveback if you disabled it by using the `storage failover modify -node local -auto-giveback true` command.
