[.lead]
To replace the controller module hardware, you must remove the impaired controller, move FRU components to the replacement controller module, install the replacement controller module in the chassis, and then boot the system to Maintenance mode.

== Step 1: Remove the controller module

[.lead]
You must remove the controller module from the chassis when you replace a component inside the controller module.

Make sure that you label the cables so that you know where they came from.

Use the following video or the tabulated steps to replace a controller module:

video::ab0ebe6b-e891-489c-aab4-ac5b015c8f01[panopto, title="Animation - Replace a controller module"]

. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.
. Unplug the controller module power supplies from the source.
. Release the power cable retainers, and then unplug the cables from the power supplies.
. Insert your forefinger into the latching mechanism on either side of the controller module, press the lever with your thumb, and gently pull the controller a few inches out of the chassis.
+
NOTE: If you have difficulty removing the controller module, place your index fingers through the finger holes from the inside (by crossing your arms).

== Step 2: Move the power supply

[.lead]
You must move the power supply from the impaired controller module to the replacement controller module when you replace a controller module.

. Disconnect the power supply.
. Open the power cable retainer, and then unplug the power cable from the power supply.
. Unplug the power cable from the power source.
. Rotate the cam handle such that it can be used to pull power supply out of the controller module while pressing the locking tab.
+
CAUTION: Do not use excessive force when sliding the controller module into the chassis to avoid damaging the connectors.
+

The power supply is short. Always use two hands to support it when removing it from the controller module so that it does not suddenly swing free from the controller module and injure you.

 .. Gently lift the boot media directly out of the socket and align it into place in the replacement controller module.
 .. Using the #1 magnetic screwdriver, insert and tighten the screw on the boot media.
+
NOTE: Do not apply force when tightening the screw on the boot media; you might crack it.

== Step 5: Move the DIMMs

[.lead]
To move the DIMMs, locate and move them from the impaired controller into the replacement controller and follow the specific sequence of steps.

image::../media/drw_a250_dimm_replace.png[]

NOTE: Install each DIMM into the same slot it occupied in the impaired controller module.

. Slowly push apart the DIMM ejector tabs on either side of the DIMM, and slide the DIMM out of the slot.
+
NOTE: Hold the DIMM by the edges to avoid pressure on the components on the DIMM circuit board.

. Locate the corresponding DIMM slot on the replacement controller module.
. Make sure that the DIMM ejector tabs on the DIMM socket are in the open position, and then insert the DIMM squarely into the socket.
+
The DIMMs fit tightly in the socket. If not, reinsert the DIMM to realign it with the socket.

. Visually inspect the DIMM to verify that it is evenly aligned and fully inserted into the socket.
. Repeat these steps for the remaining DIMM.

== Step 6: Move a mezzanine card

[.lead]
To move a mezzanine card, you must remove the cabling and any QSFPs and SFPs from the ports, move the mezzanine card to the replacement controller, reinstall any QSFPs and SFPs onto the ports, and cable the ports.

. Locate and move the mezzanine cards from your impaired controller module.
