[.lead]
The boot media stores a primary and secondary set of system (boot image) files that the system uses when it boots.

.Before you begin

You must have a USB flash drive, formatted to MBR/FAT32, with the appropriate amount of storage to hold the `image_xxx.tgz` file.

You also must copy the `image_xxx.tgz` file to the USB flash drive for later use in this procedure.

.About this task

* The nondisruptive and disruptive methods for replacing a boot media both require you to restore the `var` file system:
** For nondisruptive replacement, the HA pair must be connected to a network to restore the `var` file system.
** For disruptive replacement, you do not need a network connection to restore the `var` file system, but the process requires two reboots.
* You must replace the failed component with a replacement FRU component you received from your provider.
* It is important that you apply the commands in these steps on the correct controller:
 ** The _impaired_ node is the controller on which you are performing maintenance.
 ** The _healthy_ node is the HA partner of the impaired controller.
