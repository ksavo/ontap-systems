** If <lno-DARE> is not displayed in the command output, and the system is running ONTAP 9.5, go to <<Option 1: Checking NVE or NSE on systems running ONTAP 9.5 and earlier>>.
 ** If <lno-DARE> is not displayed in the command output, and the system is running ONTAP 9.6 or later, go to <<Option 2: Checking NVE or NSE on systems running ONTAP 9.6 and later>>.

. If the impaired node is part of an HA configuration, disable automatic giveback from the healthy node: `storage failover modify -node local -auto-giveback false` or `storage failover modify -node local -auto-giveback-after-panic false`
