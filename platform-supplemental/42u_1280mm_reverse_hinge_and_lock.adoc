When reversing the system cabinet door, you must move the system cabinet door hinge and lock catch to the opposite front-side system cabinet upright.

You need the following tools:

* Phillips screwdriver
* 5 mm Allen wrench; magnetic Allen wrench is recommended
* Needle-nose pliers
* Step ladder so that you can easily access the Allen screws in the top hinge

. Remove the screws securing the top hinge from the system cabinet frame, and set the screws and hinge aside.
+
NOTE: Be careful when removing the Allen screws to avoid dropping them into the cabinet frame. Spare Allen screws are provided in the spares kit that shipped with your system cabinet.

. Remove the screws securing the bottom hinge from the system cabinet frame, and set the screws and hinge aside.
