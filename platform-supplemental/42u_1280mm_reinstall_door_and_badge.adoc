After you reverse the door hinge and door catch, you must reinstall the grounding wire and lug assembly and wire, and the system cabinet front door prior to reinstalling the illuminated badge.

Make sure that the hinge pin is seated completely through the door hinge and the bottom of the door hinge housing.
