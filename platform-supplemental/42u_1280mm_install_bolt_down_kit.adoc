You can secure the system cabinet to the floor by installing the optional bolt-down kit. Installing the kit prevents the system cabinets from being rolled out of position.

You must supply the appropriate anchor bolt for your floor for each bolt-down bracket.

. Mark the area on your floor where the system cabinet will be installed, and then roll the cabinet into place.
