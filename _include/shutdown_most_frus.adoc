To shut down the impaired controller, you must determine the status of the controller and, if necessary, take over the controller so that the healthy controller continues to serve data from the impaired controller storage.

.About this task
* If you are using NetApp Storage Encryption, you must have reset the MSID using the instructions in the "`Returning SEDs to unprotected mode`" section of the _ONTAP 9 NetApp Encryption Power Guide_.
+
https://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/topic/com.netapp.doc.pow-nve/home.html[ONTAP 9 NetApp Encryption Power Guide^]

* If you have a SAN system, you must have checked event messages (`event log show`) for impaired controller SCSI blade.
+
Each SCSI-blade process should be in quorum with the other nodes in the cluster. Any issues must be resolved before you proceed with the replacement.

* If you have a cluster with more than two nodes, it must be in quorum. If the cluster is not in quorum or a healthy controller shows false for eligibility and health, you must correct the issue before shutting down the impaired controller; see the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/system-admin/index.html[Administration overview with the CLI^].

* If you have a MetroCluster configuration, you must have confirmed that the MetroCluster Configuration State is configured and that the nodes are in an enabled and normal state (`metrocluster node show`).

.Steps
. If AutoSupport is enabled, suppress automatic case creation by invoking an AutoSupport message: `system node autosupport invoke -node * -type all -message MAINT=number_of_hours_downh`
+
The following AutoSupport message suppresses automatic case creation for two hours: `cluster1:*> system node autosupport invoke -node * -type all -message MAINT=2h`

. Disable automatic giveback from the console of the healthy controller: `storage failover modify –node local -auto-giveback false`
+
NOTE: When you see _Do you want to disable auto-giveback?_, enter `y`.

+
. Take the impaired controller to the LOADER prompt:

| If the impaired controller is displaying...| Then...
a|
The LOADER prompt
a|
Go to Remove controller module.
a|
Waiting for giveback...
a|
Press Ctrl-C, and then respond `y` when prompted.
a|
System prompt or password prompt (enter system password)
a|
Take over or halt the impaired controller from the healthy controller: `storage failover takeover -ofnode _impaired_node_name_`

When the impaired controller shows Waiting for giveback..., press Ctrl-C, and then respond `y`.
