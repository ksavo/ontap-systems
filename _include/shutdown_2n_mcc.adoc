To shut down the impaired node, you must determine the status of the node and, if necessary, switch over the node so that the healthy node continues to serve data from the impaired node storage.

* If you are using NetApp Storage Encryption, you must have reset the MSID using the instructions in the "Returning SEDs to unprotected mode" section of the ONTAP 9 NetApp Encryption Power Guide.
+

* You must leave the power supplies turned on at the end of this procedure to provide power to the healthy node.

. Check the MetroCluster status to determine whether the impaired node has automatically switched over to the healthy node: `metrocluster show`
. Depending on whether an automatic switchover has occurred, proceed according to the following table:
+
[options="header"]
|===
| If the impaired node...| Then...
a|
Has automatically switched over
a|
Proceed to the next step.
a|
Has not automatically switched over
a|
Perform a planned switchover operation from the healthy node: `metrocluster switchover`
a|
Has not automatically switched over, you attempted switchover with the `metrocluster switchover` command, and the switchover was vetoed
a|
    Review the veto messages and, if possible, resolve the issue and try again. If you are unable to resolve the issue, contact technical support.

. Resynchronize the data aggregates by running the metrocluster heal -phase aggregates command from the surviving cluster.

----
controller_A_1::> metrocluster heal -phase aggregates
[Job 130] Job succeeded: Heal Aggregates is successful.
----
+
If the healing is vetoed, you have the option of reissuing the metrocluster heal command with the -override-vetoes parameter. If you use this optional parameter, the system overrides any soft vetoes that prevent the healing operation.

. Verify that the operation has been completed by using the metrocluster operation show command.
